# ADJUST-Assignment1

Please design a script that writes the numbers from 1 - 10 in random order.  Each number should appear only once. You can use bash only.  Please provide tests for the script, along with documentation which should include  the following:    ● Build instructions  ● Usage  ● Description  ● Known limitations / bugs 

Script:

#!/bin/bash

echo $(seq 10) |  tr " " "\n" |  shuf | tr '\n' ' '

Since there is only finte sequesnce we can use Fisher–Yates shuffle for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence


Build Instruction:

seq command in Linux is used to generate numbers from FIRST to LAST in steps of INCREMENT.
